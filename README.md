# PMR

PMR - Package Manager Runner streamlines JavaScript package managers like npm, yarn, pnpm and bun.

## Why?

As a developer who switches constantly between projects I all the have to adapt to new package managers.
First look which is used and then use the right command (e.g. only `yarn` vs `npm i`).

PMR aims to solve this problem.
